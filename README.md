# HW1
single-layer perceptron classifier

Because the training set is too large, the feature and label list are extracted in advance and placed in feature_train.npy and lable.npy.
The size of feature_train.npy exceeds 100mb, so I put these two files together with the pdf file in the moodle homework submission.

Download and unzip the image dataset to this directory and run the main.py for training.
There is a pretrain weight in checkpoint, you can run test.py for test.
